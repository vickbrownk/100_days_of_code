## Day 1: AI-Enabled Band Name Generator

Welcome back to my 100 Days of Code challenge! Today marks the first day of my renewed commitment to coding excellence. To kick things off, I created a simple yet fun AI-enabled Band Name Generator using Python.

### Project Description

- **Objective:** Create a program that generates a unique band name based on user input.
  
- **Steps Taken:**
  1. Created a warm greeting for the program.
  2. Asked the user for the name of the city they grew up in.
  3. Asked the user for the name of their pet.
  4. Combined the city name and pet name to form a creative band name.
  5. Ensured a clean and user-friendly input interface.

### How to Run

To try out the Band Name Generator:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Python script `band_name_generator.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to enter your city and pet name.
4. Discover your personalized band name suggestion!

### Thoughts and Reflections

A great start to the 100 Days of Code challenge! This project not only refreshed my Python skills but also brought a smile to my face. Excited to continue this coding journey and see what the next 99 days hold.

Stay tuned for more updates and projects throughout the challenge!

Happy coding!
