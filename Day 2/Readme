## Day 2: Advanced Tip Calculator

Welcome back to Day 2 of my 100 Days of Code journey! Today, I worked on creating an advanced tip calculator using Python. This calculator not only splits the bill among friends but also includes a customizable tip percentage.

### Project Description

- **Objective:** Build a tip calculator that takes the total bill, the number of people in the group, and the desired tip percentage as inputs, and calculates the amount each person should pay.

- **Key Features:**
  1. AI-enabled tip calculator (just for fun!).
  2. User-friendly prompts for entering the total bill, number of people, and tip percentage.
  3. Accurate calculation of the bill for each person, considering the specified tip.
  4. Rounded and formatted result to two decimal places.

### How to Run

To use the Advanced Tip Calculator:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Python script `tip_calculator.py`.
3. Enter the total bill amount when prompted.
4. Input the number of people in your group.
5. Choose the desired tip percentage (e.g., 12%, 30%, 2%).
6. Get the AI-enabled, precise amount each person should pay!

### Thoughts and Reflections

Building this tip calculator was a great exercise in handling user input, performing calculations, and formatting output. The inclusion of an AI touch adds a playful element to the project. Excited to continue exploring Python and enhancing my coding skills.

Stay tuned for more updates and projects as the 100 Days of Code challenge progresses!

Happy coding!
